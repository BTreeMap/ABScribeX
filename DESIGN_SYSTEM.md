## Implementation Details

### CSS Custom Properties
All design tokens are implemented as CSS custom properties for easy maintenance and theming:

```css
:root {
  --primary-600: #4f46e5;
  --gray-900: #111827;
  --space-lg: 1.5rem;
  --radius-xl: 1rem;
  --transition-fast: 150ms cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1);
}
```

### Component Structure
- **Modular Design**: Each component has clear boundaries and responsibilities
- **Consistent Naming**: BEM-like naming convention for CSS classes
- **Reusable Patterns**: Common patterns like buttons and cards are standardized

### Accessibility Features
- **Color Contrast**: All color combinations meet WCAG AA standards
- **Focus States**: Clear focus indicators for keyboard navigation
- **Screen Reader Support**: Proper semantic HTML structure
- **Responsive Text**: Text scales appropriately on different screen sizes
