            <p><strong>William Shakespeare</strong> (1564-1616) was an English playwright, poet, and actor. He is widely
                regarded as
                the <em>greatest writer</em> in the English language and the world's pre-eminent dramatist.</p>
            <p>Shakespeare's works include <u>39 plays</u>, 154 sonnets, and two long narrative poems. His plays have
                been
                translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other
                playwright.</p>
            <p>Some of his most famous works include <strong><em>"Romeo and Juliet," "Hamlet," "Othello," "King
                        Lear,"</em></strong>
                and <strong><em>"Macbeth."</em></strong> Shakespeare's influence on the English language and literature
                is profound
                and enduring.</p>
